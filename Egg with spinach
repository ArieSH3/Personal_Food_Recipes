Ingredients:
  -5 eggs (Amount per ones liking)
  -Butter (Almost a finger thickness)
  -Spinach (Amount per ones liking)
  -Salt (Possibly Celtic Light Gray)
  -Cashew nuts (Maybe 10 or so)

Preparation:
  -Crush cashew nuts (No need to go fine, just crushed)
  -Put butter in a pan and fry the nuts for a few minutes to enhance the flavour
  -Add eggs and break the yolks
  -Add salt 
  -Slowly stir from time to time so eggs remain barely done
  -Once half way done (Still a lot of runy egg) add spinach
  -Stir a few more times, remove off the hear and cover for a minute or so

Note:
  -Egg should be done so much that it might still have a bit of slightly runny yolk. 
    Do not overcook the egg.
